            <h1>THE FOOD YOU LOVE</h1>
            <p>Food is one of the basic necessities of life. Food contains nutrientsâ€”substances essential for the growth, repair, and maintenance of body tissues and for the regulation of vital processes. Nutrients provide the energy our bodies need to function. The energy in food is measured in units called calories.</p>

            <h2 class="product_heading">fruits</h2>
            <p>A fruit is the part of a flowering plant that contains the seeds. The skin of a fruit may be thin, tough, or hard. Its insides are often sweet and juicy. But some fruits, including nuts, are dry. Fruits develop from a plant's flowers.</p>

            <h2 class="product_heading">Non-Veg</h2>
            <p>Non-vegetarian food (in Indian English sometimes shortened to non-veg food) contains meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, or the flesh of any other animal), and sometimes, eggs. The term is common in India, but not usual elsewhere.</p>
