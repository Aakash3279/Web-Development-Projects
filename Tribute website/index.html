            <h2>Prime Minister of India</h2>
            <p><b>Narendra Damodardas Modi</b>. born 17 September 1950 is an Indian 
                politician who has served as the 14th prime minister of India 
                since May 2014. Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 
                to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament (MP) for Varanasi. He is a member 
                of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh 
                (RSS), a right wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the
                 longest-serving prime minister from outside the Indian National Congress.
                <br>
                Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his
                 secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight. His account of 
                 helping his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station has not been reliably corroborated. 
                 At age 18, he was married to Jashodaben Modi, whom he abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging
                  her four decades later when legally required to do so. Modi became a full-time worker for the RSS in 
                  Gujarat in 1971. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party
                   hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.</p>
